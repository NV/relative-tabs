Relative tabs is add-on for Firefox. It does just one thing: open new tab next to active.

Yet another?
--------------
Yes! It's very similar to [Tabs Open Relative](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1956).
The only difference between them is tab closing. In Relative tabs, after I close the tab, left one will be selected.
In Tabs Open Relative right one will be selected. Also, source code of Relative tabs much more clean.

Another very similar add-ons:  

- [Tab Control](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1480)
- [Tabs Mix Plus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1122)
- [Tab Kit](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5447)
